fp++: My functional programming playground for C++11
====================================================

Some code ported from Haskell so I can experiment with
functional programming idioms. I make no claims about the
suitability of this code for any purpose.

Pre-requisites
--------------

This library depends on:

* Clang 3.3
* Boost >= 1.52
